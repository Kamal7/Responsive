// kind of data types:
// 1. Primitive datatype ( primitive data types are defined from basic data type in javascript )
// 2. Objective datatype ( primitive data types are defined from own/custom data type in Primitive datatype )

// ========== 1. Primitive datatype ==========
// 01. Number       = 01, 0.2, 0.5
// 02. Strings      = '', "", ``
// 03. Boolean      = true or false 
// 04. undefined    = not a define 
// 05. Null         = Empty value  
// 06. bigint       => const x = 2n ** 53n; 9007199254740992n

// ========== 2. Objective datatype ==========
// 01. Object
// 02. Array
// 03. Function


// Note: Primitive datatype (In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. There are 6 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, and symbol. There also is null, which is seemingly primitive, but indeed is a special case for every Object: and any structured type is derived from null by the Prototype Chain.Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.)
